reading five temperature sensors (DS18B20) with a raspberry-pi and store the data in a csv-file

It is my first (real) repository here on github - let's see, how it works ;-)

The code currently works in a test. There are some minor issues in the code (e.g. the header for the csv is not entirely correct but that does't matter for now)
